                <p>
                I'm the Web Developer for StrikeOutStroke in Melbourne. I have serious passion for coding, designing and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.
                I loves programming, writing, speaking and traveling. I am the founder of Websoles, Web Development Company. I am Graduated from La Trobe University, Australia.
                My career has taken a natural progression from client websites, to template clubs, to UI templates, to UX design, to complex analytical UX design.
                As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why Iâ€™m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs. When I'm not coding, tweeting or pushing pixels, you'll find me travelling, gaming or watching action movies.
